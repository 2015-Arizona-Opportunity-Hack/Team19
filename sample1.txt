We got the flash-drives and highlighters in a special presentation to our school\u2019s clubs and were thrilled! During the past month, we were focused on preparing for our first competition. That happened last weekend and we did well for a rookie team, placing 10th out of 19 schools, some with more than 50 competitors. We had 13 students in the competition which tested us in language and literature, art, music, science, social science, economics, and math. We also had to interview, and perform prepared and impromptu speeches. The flash-drives and highlighters helped us immensely as we studied. We were able to mark the 2000-plus pages of text, and check out the targeted art and music selections we downloaded to the flash-drives. And we had our resumes and speeches conveniently at hand. Our next competition on January 31st and February 1st will pit our top nine students against the top nine students from 28 other high schools in our region. Wish us luck!

Donations like a target help us in our mission of bringing archery activities to Camelback and to give students an opportunity to experience archery and to give them the opportunity to participate in after school activities and competitions.\r\n\r\nAttached are photos of us using the new target in a recent after school meeting.\r\n\r\nIn order to fulfill our volunteer commitment, we are scheduled to support a feeder school spring fair and fundraiser on the 4th of April. We will send pictures and a message when we complete it.\r\n\r\nThank you again,\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tEfrain Villa\r\n\t\t\t\t\tCamelback Archery Club President\r\n\r\n","Field2":"img_7547.jpg (https:\/\/supportmyclub.wufoo.com\/cabinet\/x7o68ah12q3jf2\/Y7rvPWtrs7E%3D\/img_7547.jpg)","Field3":"img_7526.jpg (https:\/\/supportmyclub.wufoo.com\/cabinet\/x7o68ah12q3jf2\/Y7rvPWtrs7E%3D\/img_7526.jpg)","Field4":"img_7565.jpg (https:\/\/supportmyclub.wufoo.com\/cabinet\/x7o68ah12q3jf2\/Y7rvPWtrs7E%3D\/img_7565.jpg)","Field8":"","Field9":"","Field17":"","DateCreated":"2014-03-13 13:55:37","CreatedBy":"public","DateUpdated":"","UpdatedBy":null},{"EntryId":"100","Field11":"North","Field13":"National Art Honor Society","Field15":"Set of 72 Prismacolor Premier Pencils","Field1":"Thank you so much for generous gift!
