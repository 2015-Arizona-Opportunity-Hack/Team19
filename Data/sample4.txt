Being a student in high school, it becomes difficult to communicate and express yourself. That\u2019s why I am involved in poetry. When I write poetry, I put my whole heart and soul onto paper. When I recite my poetry I tell my whole life story to people on a stage, versus when I barely tell my closest friends things.\r\nI know doing what you do, you must have a lot of busy days. That\u2019s why I want to thank you for taking time out of your busy day to help the poetry club progress. I can\u2019t stress enough how it really meant a lot to me for you to do that. I\u2019m really grateful for your present of the microphone. I feel that it could help the poetry club in the future, and I\u2019m very happy that the future members of the club will get a chance to experience it.\r\n\tEver since I was younger I have had a fear of public speaking. Poetry helped me overcome that. I know there are still a lot of things Poetry Club is lacking, but with the microphone you donated there can be a start.\r\n\tWhen I graduate high school, I want go to college to study law school in hopes of becoming a lawyer. Being a lawyer requires a lot of speaking and persuading. Since you prepared me for speaking I know I\u2019m one step closer to succeeding my goal.\r\n\tWhether you know it or not you have done a lot for the club. one day I hope I can repay the favor. Although we can\u2019t do that now I can in the future by showing you how you affected my life. You\u2019ve given students a chance to tell their story and touched the hearts of many. I may never know what it\u2019s like to do your job, but I just want to personally say thank you.\r\n\r\n\tSincerely; Nijah Morgan\r\n","Field2":"poetry_letter.pptx (https:\/\/supportmyclub.wufoo.com\/cabinet\/x7o68ah12q3jf2\/16j3IfQ0x80%3D\/poetry_letter.pptx)","Field3":"","Field4":"","Field8":"","Field9":"","Field17":"No hours to log","DateCreated":"2015-05-13 10:43:59","CreatedBy":"public","DateUpdated":"","UpdatedBy":null},{"EntryId":"403","Field11":"Marana High School","Field13":"Marana Early Childhood FCCLA","Field15":"Confrence Registration Funds","Field21":"","Field1":"Thank you so much for your generosity.
