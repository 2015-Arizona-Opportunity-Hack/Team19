We want to say thank you so much for your donation and support of the Camelback Archery Club and the Support My Club Website.\r\n\r\n2. Your funds provided needed additional equipment for us to expand our opportunities to practice and teach archery techniques. Our club members enjoy shooting and competing and want you to know they greatly appreciate your gift.\r\n\r\n3. We also would like to report to you that on 19 January 2013 that 6 members of the Archery Club assisted with a community clean up with the Phoenix Police Department. We cleaned alleys and painted over graffiti for just over three hours in a Phoenix neighborhood near the intersection of 16th Street and Osborn. \r\n\r\n4.
