This is very expensive added addition to the students and such a blessing that you are so kind as to donate these stoles for the DECA Students.  The picture was taken on Thursday, May 22, 2014.  This is right before they walked at gradation.  This is a bitter sweet day for me, it is the day that I send my students out into the world to make a difference.

Just a little background on us \uf04a we started a sustainability program here at South Mountain High as a way to give our students with special needs (autism, intellectual disability etc.) a way to connect with their curriculum. Due to their disability their curriculum is focused on life skills and vocational training both of which directly links to the garden. Now instead of buying carrots at the store for a cooking class the kids can pick them from the garden, and see how their food is grown. The program has also been great for giving students a hands on vocational experience in which they learn working and communication skills. Finally the garden has been a great way for the students to interact with their non-disabled peers. Planting seeds and tending to plants is something everyone can do regardless of disability.
